## Microstates Definition {background-color="#346bc8"}

"EEG microstates are brief, recurring periods of stable brain activity that reflect the activation of `large-scale neural networks`. The temporal characteristics of these microstates, including their average duration, number of occurrences, and percentage contribution have been shown to `serve` as biomarkers of mental and neurological disorders" [@kleinert2024].

## The use of Microstates {background-color="#346bc8"}

"Recent publications demonstrate the potential of microstate research to `contribute` to a more sophisticated diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis, and prevention of mental disorders in clinical psychology and psychiatry. Microstate characteristics may serve as `biomarkers` of schizophrenia (da Cruz et al. 2020; de Bock et al. 2020), affective disorders (Al Zoubi et al. 2019; Damborská et al. 2019b; Murphy et al. 2020), anxiety disorders (Al Zoubi et al. 2019), ADHD (Férat et al. 2022a), and autism (D’Croz-Baron et al. 2019; Bochet et al. 2021). as mentioned in [@kleinert2024a]"

## Processing for Microstates analysis {background-color="#346bc8"}

EEG data processing (as described in the previous labs) has historically been recommended by many experts. However, recent research shows that the EEG data processing (or over-processing) could be counterproductive. Therefore, it is sensible to process the data to only the extent that is needed to obtain microstates that resemble the prototypical four to seven network types.

## Processing continued.... {background-color="#346bc8"}

To the best of my knowledge, it is important to use only the following processing steps:

1.  Add channel locations
2.  Filter 2-20 Hz
3.  Remove artefacts with ASR, but make sure to un-check the option `Remove channel if it is flat for more than (seconds)`, see @fig-artefact-ms.
4.  Reference to average and interpolate removed channels.

5.  From `Tools -> Microstates -> Obtain Microstate Maps`, use `k-means` method with a min of 4 and max of 5 maps, and set `restarts` to 20, see @fig-snap-ms.
6.  From `Plots ->` ...
7.  Examine whether or not your obtained microstates resemble the prototypical four (or seven) network types (see @fig-fourmaps) [@nash2022].
