## Pipeline {background-color="#346bc8"}

![](/figs/pipeline.png)

[EEGLab Preprocessing - Delorme](https://youtu.be/gEk33jWB0MY)

## Recap {background-color="#346bc8"}

-   Referencing and filtering
-   Removing unwanted channels
-   Removing artefacts

## Independent Component Analysis (ICA) {background-color="#346bc8"}


::: incremental

-   Why we need ICA?
-   ICA is a signal processing method to separate independent sources linearly mixed in several sensors (ICA for Dummies - By Delorme)
-   Let's watch the video together: [ICA by Delorme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWAjhXr7pT4)
-   Remove artefacts, make sure you have enough data (20 * square of number of channels), high pass filter at 0.5, remove bad channels.

::: 


## Running ICA {background-color="#346bc8"}

::: incremental

-   Use the the `Lab 2 demo` dataset on Learn.
-   Use `Tools -> Decompose data by ICA`. Select `Infomax runica.m (default)`, `extended 1` (helps to detect line noise).
-   You can also plot all or individual component maps from the `Plot` menu. 
-   Use `Tools -> Inspect/label components by map`. 
-   Use `Tools -> Remove components from data`.

## Continued {background-color="#346bc8"}

::: incremental

-   Or, do this automatically: `Tools -> Classify components using ICLabel`, then flag components as artefacts.
-   Important: DON'T remove/reject components if you are conducting group level analysis (we will learn about group level analysis later).

# Exercise {background-color="orange"}

## To submit {background-color=#346bc8}

-   Use the the `Lab 2 exercise` dataset on Learn.
-   Conduct pipeline processing as per usual (using last week's processing too).
-   Run ICA, share a screenshot.
-   Remove components, share a screenshot.
-   Compare pre- and post-analysis attributes.
-   Compare pre- and post-analysis Channel data (scroll). What do you conclude? Any problems/issues? Why or why not? (consists 25% of today's mark).
